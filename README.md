# TopicDNA-NLP-R-Code
This NLP Model I have implemented for tweets analysis.

My twitter data has following variables:

1. Topic
2. Subtopic
3. Sub-subtopic
4. Tweets
5. Hashtags
6. Emojis
7. Date

I have cleaned ActualTopic.csv data and divided it into train and test data.

Below algorithms I have implemented using this data and for this I have used R Studio R version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21).

1. Conditional Inference Trees
2. Random Forest Algorithm
3. Weighted K Nearest Neighbour

Among these algorithms I have chosen Weighted K Nearest Neighbour because it has given me 99% accuracy in prediction of topic based on words used in tweets.
